<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)-->

An Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is a computer vision technology to read and recognize license plate numbers on vehicles. ANPR systems are commonly used for security and surveillance purposes, such as identifying stolen or wanted vehicles, monitoring traffic flow, and enforcing parking regulations.

Implementing an ANPR system involves several steps, including image acquisition, preprocessing, segmentation and character recognition. The system captures an image of the vehicle's license plate using a camera, applies various image processing techniques to enhance the image quality and extract the license plate region, segments the individual characters on the plate, recognizes the characters.

## Built With

## OpenCV

OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a variety of tools for image and video processing, feature detection, and machine learning. In this project, OpenCV is used for tasks such as reading and writing image and video files, preprocessing images for object detection and recognition, and visualizing the results of machine learning algorithms.

## Python

Python is a versatile programming language that is widely used for machine learning and scientific computing tasks. In this project, Python is used as the primary programming language to implement machine learning algorithms, process and analyze data, and integrate with other libraries and tools.

## YOLOv7

YOLOv7 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm that uses deep learning techniques to identify and classify objects in images and videos. In this project, YOLOv7 is used to detect and track vehicles in traffic footage, and to provide data for further analysis and processing.

## Torch

Torch is a popular machine learning library that provides tools for deep learning, optimization, and data processing. In this project, Torch is used to implement and train machine learning models for vehicle detection and recognition, and to provide the core framework for integrating with other libraries and tools.

## Numpy

Numpy is a powerful library for numerical computing and data analysis in Python. In this project, Numpy is used for tasks such as data manipulation, preprocessing, and feature extraction, and to provide the core data structures for machine learning algorithms.

## Tensorflow

Tensorflow is a widely used machine learning library that provides tools for deep learning, optimization, and data processing. In this project, Tensorflow is used to implement and train machine learning models for vehicle detection and recognition, and to provide the core framework for integrating with other libraries and tools.

## Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is a popular machine learning library that provides a variety of tools for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training and evaluation. In this project, Scikit-learn is used for tasks such as data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, and to provide additional machine learning algorithms and tools.
